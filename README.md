This purpose of this repository is to document my Data Science projects. The projects are for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. The projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebook and were written in Python 3. Below are descriptions of the projects included in this repository. The notebooks are best viewed through [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Projects
* [**E-commerce Recommendation System**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/m-rbn/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/E-commerce_Recommendation_System/E-Commerce_Recommendation.ipynb)
  * This notebook aims to create a recommendation system for an e-commerce dataset. The dataset was collected from a real-world e-commerce dataset. Using this dataset, three different models of recommendation system was developed using the Collaborative Filtering Technique.
  * Tools: ***Pandas, NumPy & Scikit-learn***
* [**Predicting Customer Churn**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/m-rbn/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Telco_Customer_Churn/Telco_Customer_Churn.ipynb)
  * The objective of this notebook is to build a model that can predict which customer will churn. [Churn rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate), as defined in wikipedia, is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. Therefore, customers who churns are individuals who are no longer using the service of a business. The dataset which will be used in this notebook is a telecommunications company's anonymous customer data.
  * Tools: ***Pandas, NumPy, Matpotlib, XGBoost & Scikit-learn***
* [**Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) Analysis for Customer Segmentation**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/m-rbn/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/RFM_Analysis_for_Customer_Segmentation/RFM_Analysis.ipynb)
  * The objective of this notebook is to conduct customer segmentation using Recency-Frequency-Monetary (*RFM*) analysis. Customer segmentation divides a pool of customers into discrete customer segment who shares similar characteristic. *RFM* analysis divides groups of customers by focusing on three metrics: *Recency*, *Frequency* and *Monetary Value*. Based on these three metrics, markerters will be able to decide the most appropriate marketing strategy for a specific customer segment.
  * Tools: ***Pandas & NumPy***
